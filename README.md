# FGA-Data-Science

# Overview
This repository contains materials and projects completed during the Data Science Fresh Graduate Academy 2024, a 3-month intensive program organized by Binar Academy in collaboration with Kominfo. The program is designed to equip participants with the necessary skills to become proficient data scientists.

# Program Objectives
The main objectives of this program are to:

- Teach SQL querying techniques for effective data manipulation.
- Provide knowledge on data analysis and visualization methods.
- Introduce machine learning concepts and algorithms.
- Offer practical experience through case studies and real-world applications.

1. Basics of Data Science
2. Introduction to SQL
3. Advanced SQL querying
## Month 2: Data Analysis and Visualization
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data Visualization techniques using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Tableau
## Month 3: Machine Learning and Case Studies

2. Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
3. Implementing Machine Learning models
4. Case Studies and real-world applications

# Projects
## SQL Queries
- Total Active COVID-19 Cases by Province: Aggregated and ordered by the highest cases.
- Lowest Total COVID-19 Deaths by ISO Code: Selected top 2 locations.
- Dates with Highest Recovery Rates in Indonesia: Sorted by the highest recovery rates.
- Lowest Total Case Rates by ISO Code: Summed recovery and fatality rates.
- Dates with Total COVID-19 Cases ≥ 30,000: Retrieved dates meeting the threshold.
- Count of Records with Total Cases ≥ 30,000: Counted occurrences.
## Dashboard Development
- COVID-19 Dashboard: Visualized COVID-19 data for Indonesia, including geographic distribution and daily case trends.
- Scoreboard and Charts: Displayed active, recovered, and fatal cases, with bar charts comparing provinces.

## Machine Learning Case Study
Customer Churn Prediction:
- EDA: Analyzed churn distribution and relationships with categorical and numerical features.
- Preprocessing: Addressed outliers, handled missing values, standardized features, and encoded categorical data.
- Model Training: Implemented Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers, utilized SMOTE for imbalanced data, and performed hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.
- Evaluation: Assessed models using confusion matrix and feature importance, optimizing for recall to minimize false negatives.
